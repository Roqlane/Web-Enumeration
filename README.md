# Web-Enumeration

This tool can be used to enumerate different page of a website by using multiple wordlists at the same time. You already have several wordlists available if you are lazy to get one. The wordlists inside the project were made by merging wordlists that already exist and by using ChatGPT. But please note that it is possible that some words are in several of these 4 wordlists.
